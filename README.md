[de la Vega et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14972) searched for galaxies with large star-forming regions, known as "clumps," in star-forming galaxies over 2<z<12 in the publicly available JWST dataset JADES ([Rieke et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..269...16R/abstract); [Eisenstein et al. 2023a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230602465E/abstract); [2023b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231012340E/abstract); [Bunker et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...690A.288B/abstract); [D'Eugenio et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240406531D/abstract)). The clump-finding algorithm by [Sattari et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951..147S/abstract) was used. This repository contains a jupyter notebook (clumpy_galaxy_fraction.ipynb) that can be used to reproduce Figure 7 in de la Vega et al. (2025), which shows the fraction of clumpy galaxies as a function of redshift. The directory clump_finding_results.zip contains files with results from the clump-finding algorithm. They are used to compute the clumpy fraction. A compilation of clumpy fractions from the literature is also shown.  

The repository also contains a catalog of physical properties (jades_clumps_2_z_12_physical_properties.txt) derived by fitting the HST+JWST spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 15,412 galaxies. The fits were performed using the Bayesian SED-fitting tool BAGPIPES ([Carnall et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.4379C/abstract)). The catalog lists the JADES IDs, redshifts and uncertainties and provenances thereof, log specific star-formation rates (SFRs) averaged over the last 10 and 100 Myr (columns beginning with "log_SFR_10_" and "log_SFR_100_"), log stellar masses (columns beginning with "log_mstar_"), dust attenuations in the rest-frame _V_ band (Av, columns beginning with "AV_"), and mass-weighted ages in Gyr (columns beginning with "mwa_"). For each quantity after the redshifts, the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles of the marginalized posteriors are provided in columns ending in "\_16," "
\_50," and "\_84," respectively. For more details, please see Sec. 2.3 in [de la Vega et al. (2025)](link TBD). 

Last, the directory PSF.zip contains FITS images of empirical point spread functions (PSFs) of JWST/NIRCam filters in JADES. They were used to compute aperture corrections that are needed when performing photometry on detected clumps. Parameters from [Zhuang & Shen (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...962..139Z/abstract) were used to construct empirical PSFs in photutils [(Bradley et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024zndo..10967176B/abstract), which uses the algorithm by [Anderson & King (2000)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PASP..112.1360A/abstract).
